<h1>TimePlayed</h1>
<p>The easy-to-use Discord bot<br> that measures your playtime</p>
<h2>Hi there, I am TimePlayed</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 30px">I am a bot that helps you as server owner to view what games are popular in your server, and to get users to be active in your server. I'm measuring your playtime using Discord presences, so you and your server members will have an overview about how long and which games they play.<br>
<strong>It's quite useful, you should definitely give it a try!</strong></p>
